"""
This module contains the algorithm used in the program's fuzzy
searcher. It calculates the edit distance the query and items in the
repository and generates a list of items of best match.

The edit (Levenshtein) distance denotes the number of
single character operations (insertion, deletion, substitution)
required to transform the source to the target. We construct a
len(source) * len(target) matrix and calculate the diagonal of
said matrix formed by checking for the deletions, insertions, and
substitutions needed.

For example, given "carrot" and "carry", we note it
takes a deletion of "t" and a substitution of "y" for
"o" to transform the source to the target, so the
edit distance is 2. The corresponding matrix is:

                    C  A  R  R  Y
                 0  1  2  3  4  5
               C 1  0  1  2  3  4
               A 2  1  0  1  2  3
               R 3  2  1  0  1  2
               R 4  3  2  1  0  1
               O 5  4  3  2  1  1
               T 6  5  4  3  2 [2]

The search algorithm checks for instances in the target
where the source is found, and recursively checks to
said instances up to a sensitivity. The algorithm is
able to check for multiple occurrences in the target
where the source occurs to prevent false non-detections.

For example, given "books" and "www.ourbookstore.com", the
algorithm checks if "books" and "ooks" are in the target.
