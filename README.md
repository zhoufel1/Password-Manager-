# Password-Manager- 

A python-based password manager for personal use. It automatically creates secure randomly generated passwords, encrypts them, and stores account information in an embedded database. The account information is then decrypted when retrieved.

## Encryption 
Since we are storing account information, it is essential that such data is encrypted before it is stored. The program uses the cryptography library built upon AES-128 in conjunction with PBKDF2 with SHA256 to generate keys. Salt for the key generator is derived by python's cryptographically secure random number generator, urandom. 

## Getting Started 
### Setup and Dependencies 
Program is tested on Python 3.6. It is recommended you initialize a python virtual environment and do:
```
$ pip3 install py-bcrypt
$ pip3 install cryptography 
$ pip3 install sqlalchemy
```
Then clone the repository by doing:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zhoufel1/Password-Manager-.git
```
### How To Use 
To run the program, ensure permissions with:
```
$ chmod u+x main.py
```
and run:
```
$ ./main.py
```
On first startup, the program will initialize an embedded database and prompt the user to create a password. 

Onwards, the program will prompt the user for that created password.

Since this program doesn't have a GUI, input numbers to access the various options. 

For ease, when querying for accounts by website, you can enter keywords (e.g., entering gmail rather than ht<span>tp</span>://w<span>ww.gm</span>ail.com)
