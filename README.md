## Features
Pypass serves as an alternative to pricey and bloated GUI-based password managers as well as CLI solutions that are well made but often hard to use. Some
features include:

* Secure storage of passwords in an embedded database.
* SHA256 based encryption.
* Organized tree based visualization of account information.
* Fuzzy saerching for account information
* Copy to clipboard

## Encryption
It is essential that account data is encrypted before it is stored. This program uses the `cryptography` library built on AES-128 in conjunction with PBKDF2 (SHA256) to generate keys. The passwords are salted using the secure random number generator from `urandom`.

## User Guide
### Setup and Dependencies
It is recommended to use Python3.6.1+. The following dependencies are necessary:
```
$ pip3 install py-bcrypt
$ pip3 install cryptography
$ pip3 install sqlalchemy
$ pip3 install pyperclip
```
Then clone the repository by doing:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zhoufel1/Password-Manager-.git
```
### Using
The program is executed through via the 'run' script:
```
$ ./run
```
The program will prompt for the creation of a master password which will be used to access the database on future use.

It is recommended for future convenience to have a shell script to run the program.<br/>

Here is an example script that will activate a virtual environment containing the dependencies, run the program, and deactivate the virtual environment on exit.
```
#!/bin/bash

# Activate venv called 'password' containing the dependencies
source $HOME/.virtualenvs/password/bin/activate

# Run program
cd $HOME/Other/Password-Manager-
./run

# Terminate venv on program close.
deactivate
```

#### Fuzzy searching
To aid with accessing items in the repository, the program has a fuzzy searcher which will return items associated with the user query.<br/>

#### Password Copying
Passwords are copied to the clipboard directly after query. The system
clipboard is purged after the program terminates.<br/>
